### 👋 Hi there!

:octocat: My name is Viktor.

I'm a software engineer with a passion for building innovative and high-quality applications. I have experience in a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript (NodeJS, Typescript), Solidity and C++, and enjoy solving complex problems and learning new technologies.

In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new projects or contributing to open source software. I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow and learn as a developer, so feel free to reach out!
